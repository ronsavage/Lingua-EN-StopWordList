=head1 NAME

Lingua::EN::StopWordList - A sorted list of English stop words

=head1 Synopsis

	use Lingua::EN::StopWordList;

	my($ara_ref) = Lingua::EN::StopWordList -> new -> words;

Here's a complete program:

	use strict;
	use warnings;
	use Lingua::EN::StopWordList;

	my($count) = 0;

	print map{"@{[++$count]}: $_\n"} @{Lingua::EN::StopWordList -> new -> words};

=head1 Description

C<Lingua::EN::StopWordList> is a pure Perl module.

It returns a sorted arrayref of 659 English stop words.

=head1 Constructor and initialization

new(...) returns an object of type C<Lingua::EN::StopWordList>.

This is the class's contructor.

Usage: C<< Lingua::EN::StopWordList -> new >>.


=head1 Distributions

This module is available as a Unix-style distro (*.tgz).

Install C<Lingua::EN::StopWordList> as you would for any C<Perl> module:

Run:

	cpanm Lingua::EN::StopWordList

or run:

	sudo cpan Lingua::EN::StopWordList

or unpack the distro, and then run one of:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

or

	perl Makefile.PL
	make (or dmake)
	make test
	make install

See L<http://savage.net.au/Perl-modules.html> for details.

See L<http://savage.net.au/Perl-modules/html/installing-a-module.html> for
help on unpacking and installing.

=head1 Methods

=head2 new()

See L</Constructor and initialization>.

=head2 words()

Returns the sorted arrayref of English stop words.

=head1 FAQ

=head2 Is there a definitive list of stop words?

No, there is no such thing as a definitive list.
For an important discussion, e.g. including 'phrase search', see
L<the Wikipedia discussion of word lists|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words>.

=head2 Where does the list come from?

I downloaded it from the bottom of this page: L<http://www.translatum.gr/forum/index.php?topic=2476.0>.
It contains 659 words.

=head2 Are there other lists available?

Sure. Try L<http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume5/lewis04a/a11-smart-stop-list/english.stop>.
This list contains 570 words.

Another good place to look is L<http://www.ranks.nl/resources/stopwords.html>, but its English list
only contains 174 words. Since L<Lingua::StopWords> (below) also has 174 words in its Englist list,
perhaps this is where that module got its words from.
Lastly, it has stop word lists for a whole range of languages.

Alternately, just Google for references to various lists. Note however these lists are normally very
short.

=head2 Why another Perl module for stop words?

L<Lingua::StopWords> only has a short list of words (174). And its bug list goes back 3 years.

L<Lingua::EN::StopWords> only has a short list of words (227). Also, this module is part of
L<Lingua::EN::Segmenter>, whose documentation is poor. Even the exact basis of how it splits text
is not documented. Lastly, its bug list goes back 6 years.

I could have offered to take over maintentance of either or both those modules, but there are problems:

=over 4

=item o L<Lingua::StopWords>

It ships with a set of sub-modules, with names like L<Lingua::StopWords::EN>, but I'm not in a position
to support its other languages if I put my module's English list into it.

Nevertheless, the fact that it supports 13 languages is definitely something in favour of this module.

=item o L<Lingua::EN::StopWords>

This is part of text processing stuff which I don't want to get involved with. Also, it has a long
list of pre-reqs (not listed on MetaCPAN until you view the makefile), which may well suit the purposes
of L<Lingua::EN::Segmenter>, but is overkill for just a stop word list.

=back

Several other Perl modules, written for various purposes, either use one of the above, or have their
own very short (as always) lists.

=head2 How can I help?

If you translate the list of stop words in this module into your favourite language and email it to
me, I will include your words in the next release.

It all depends on whether you think this new list is somehow 'better' than the lists in pre-existing
modules. I cannot make that decision on your behalf.
